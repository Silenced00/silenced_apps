Reported Statistics for attendance in the Worldwide Church of God as of 1967 are as follows. (Report on Worldwide Distribution of Manpower, 1967).

The Report on Worldwide Distribution of Manpower, 1967, was a very detailed booklet that showed specific attendance figures from region to region, church areas, and the ministry listed for each local congregation. However, it did not detail local congregation exact attendance figures. What I have done (and this was not in the booklet this information is derived from) is averaged the district attendance with the number of congregations to figure out a district wide average local church attendance. Some undoubtably were smaller, and some were greater, but the average generally was from about 250 to nearly 400.

TOTAL WORLDWIDE:  41,732 in attendance.

This indicates that there were, in 1966, 36,621 in attendance at Local Church areas in the United States. Only 10 more years of strong growth would continue until just after 1975 when growth began to steadily decline for a number of years.

Worldwide, there were 158 local churches in 1966. If we take the total attendance in 1966 and divide that by the congregations, we have an average of  264 in attendance per local congregation on an average.

Now, comes the guesswork. The following was not in the manpower distribution booklet.

These numbers are “attendance” figures, and count total attendance, not baptized members, of the church. Therefore, if we were to take  41,732 attenders, we can probably say that the amount of baptized members was PROBABLY, as a guess, around 35,000, with the rest being children of the members and non member attender. . Not every wife worked back in 1966, and there were non working elderly and disabled, so we can probably guess Worldwide  tithepayers would PROBABLY be right around 30,000 tithe-payers, strictly as a guess.

These figures and numbers are very important to understand. The reason being is simple: In 1985, Herbert Armstrong claimed that there were nearly 140,000 members within the Worldwide Church of God. This was documented on a festival video, where Herbert claimed that we were nearing the 144,000 members that were mentioned in the book of Revelation – the number of the very Elect of God. He clearly indicated members, not just those in attendance, as many non-attenders and children were not baptized. If in 1966 we had (and again, a guess) around 30,000 tithe paying baptized members, that would mean the numbers would have to more then quadruple to equal the approximately 144,000 members that would be required to be God’s Elect, the number needed biblically.

There is a problem with this. And that is, in growth numbers.

In 1967, there were about nine more years of rapid growth in the Church. The actual statistics of growth year after year after 1967 indicate that after 1975 there was a marked decline in church growth that lasted quite a few years. It was a sharp enough decline in Growth that Herbert armstrong had to take decisive action to “get the church back on track”. It took approximately 40 years or so to get from 0 members to the approximately 42,000 worldwide attenders.  The growth acceleration curve would have had to go off the charts to hit approximately 140,000 members from 1966 to 1986, which were an additional 20 years to somehow double the attendance.  not counting attenders and nonmembers. If he meant attenders, then the growth would still have to be vivacious.

One way we can look at this statistically is by looking at the number of Y.E.S. (Youth Educational Services) magazines were sent to the Youth. In 1983, the subscriptions to Y.E.S. Lessons were 19,915. According to the Y.E.S. Pastor’s Manual, 25% of the 19,915 was outside of the United States that were sent. Also, an additional 10 percent were received by non-church youth. Of 19,915 in the United States then, in 1983, the amount being sent to church youth would appear to be approximately 12,945. Estimates of church growth would PROBABLY average a multiple of 2 or 3, so a guess would be another maybe 35,000 members or so by 1983, creating a POSSIBLE member total of somewhere around 76,000 total as a GUESSED AVERAGE. Still, using that approximate formula, way under 140,000 members, if this is even close to correct as an average.
